Ablation is a tool for augmenting static analysis by extracting information at runtime, and importing it into IDA. 

	- Resolve virtual calls.
	- Maximize code audits by revealing interesting code.
	- Exclude heavily traversed regions.
	- Identify untested or undocumented features.
	- Visually diff samples.
	- Perform root cause analysis simply by running samples.
		
My favourite however is the virtual call resolution with fully interactive x-refs. It's simple, elegant, and disassembled C++ reads like C! It helps me time and time again. 

Ablation helps you focus on the research.
